/* The Reconcile tab makes ONE claim: this store banked what it sold that week. Everything that can
 * go wrong with that claim is arithmetic on dates, and none of it announces itself — a week summed
 * over the wrong seven days still prints a confident figure, and a deposit filed under the wrong
 * week makes two weeks wrong at once while the totals still look plausible.
 *
 * So this file runs the REAL shipped functions (lifted out of index.html, not restated here) over
 * dates chosen to sit on the failure boundaries:
 *
 *   1. Week windows must honour the PER-STORE start day. Some stores run Tue->Mon and some Wed->Tue
 *      because that is when Shawn deposits; a Monday-week assumption silently shifts a day of sales
 *      into the neighbouring week, and both weeks then disagree with the bank by that day's takings.
 *   2. The window maths must not touch the local timezone. `new Date('2026-08-18')` is midnight UTC
 *      and is the 17th anywhere west of Greenwich, so a naive implementation misfiles the boundary
 *      day for every user in Oregon. Asserted by running the boundary cases under TZ=America/
 *      Los_Angeles (see the re-exec at the top).
 *   3. A deposit is made AFTER the week it pays for, so attribution cannot use its own date
 *      directly. The default rule is "the most recent window that had already ENDED"; a deposit
 *      dated ON a window's first day must pay for the week that just closed, not the one opening.
 *   4. Expected = Net Sales + TAX. Tax is the half that was missing from the daily records until
 *      this feature added it, and dropping it understates every week by roughly the tax rate.
 *   5. A window with a missing day must report incomplete, NOT a shortfall. This is the difference
 *      between "we haven't loaded Tuesday" and "Tuesday's money never arrived", and a reconciliation
 *      screen that confuses the two sends someone hunting for a theft that did not happen.
